            <p className='leading-7 text-xl font-light align-baseline text-justify'>Hello!!! Thanks for visiting my space and taking the time to read about me. I am Sanju from Rajasthan and I live in Bangalore. I am working in IT industry as a software engineer for 10 years. I am mother of Rudransh Rathore and during this time I found my passion! Yes it's cooking and clicking, and so this blog!
 
 Though I am fond of food and like to taste different varieties, but started my own cooking after my marriage as I never entered into the kitchen because of my lovable mom and only had the opportunity to enjoy her yummy food. But after marriage, I started cooking vigorously. My husband is a best critic, and that helps me to improve my cooking.</p>
        
        
        <p className='leading-7 text-xl font-light'>The recipes posted here are tried and tasted in my kitchen,traditional native recipes from my mom, baby foods which I feed my baby and few other recipes tried from friends, cookbooks or other food blogs.Being a health-conscious person, most of my recipes are focuses on health. (Some are exceptional though)</p>
